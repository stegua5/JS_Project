# JS_Project
The project is an exercise for a web design course and I do not own any rights on pictures and assets which belong to their respective owners.
The website is a chain of reastaurants from italy, spain and china and has been developed to meet the needs of the customers.
Each restaurant has text description and a jQuery gallery with photos of the their best dishes. While on the left side on each section there is a box with comments from the people about the dinners experience.
At the and of the website the client can book the table and the time of arrival through a Form validation.

Form validation and modal window to proof that the details are correct.
