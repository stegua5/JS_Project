# JS_Project
The project is an exercise for a web development course and I do not own any rights on pictures and assets which belong to their respective owners.
The website is a chain of restaurants from italy, spain and china and has been developed to meet the needs of the customers.
Each restaurant has a detailed text description and a jQuery gallery with photos of the their best dishes. While on the left side on each section there is a box with comments from the people about the dinners experience in the restaurant.
At the and of the website the client can book the table and the time of arrival through a Form validation.

Form validation and modal window to proof that the details are correct.
